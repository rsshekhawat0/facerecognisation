i have created the  facerecognisation model here i have used the same archetecture of the 
resnet50 here i have freezed the layers of resnet50 and i have created fully created layers
and then i have combined those layers with the help of Model function here i have passed the
inputs and outputs then it combined them and till here my archtecture was ready and then
i have limited images of mine and deep learning requires lot of images thats why i have used image generator 
there which can create more images of mne by just changing slight angle,colour and etc and then after this
i have passed these images in my model and then i have predict my photo and it has recognised me
